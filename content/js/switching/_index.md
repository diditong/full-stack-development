It is often the case that we need to switch to our secondary programming language in a coding interview, e.g., there is no ready-to-use heaps, queues, etc. in JavaScript so we want to switch to Python. However, people can mess up with grammars of different languages especially they have been writing code in the original language for a long time. Even though they usually recall the correct grammar after several trials, it can seem so unprofessiontal that the interviewer gets very well annoyed. To solve this problem, I have created the following table which summarizes the grammar to use (in columns) for each use case (in rows). 

| 左对齐 | Python | JavaScript |
| | :----: | :----: |
| Identifiers | No identifiers | const, let, and var |
| Symbols | : for func definiton, no ; | {} for func definition, ; after each sentence |
| Naming Conventions | var_name, func_name, ClassName, CONST_NAME | varName, funcName, ClassName, CONST_NAME |
| List/Array |  | |
| Dictionary/Object |  | |
| Heap | | |
| Queue | | |
| Stack ||
