Hello! I am Jiashuo Tong, a master's student in Computer Science at University of Southern California. Here is my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiashuotong/

I created this website for two purposes:
1. Document my practical and theoretical knowledge in software development, data structures, algorithms, programming languages, etc. 
2. Let people know about my past experiences and connect myself with potential job opportunities.

I have project experiences with multiple languages and frameworks (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Spring Boot, Python Flask, React, Angular, MySQL, NoSQL, etc.). My strengths reside in designing and writing efficient algorithms to solve problems and utilizing cloud computing resources to increase productivity.
