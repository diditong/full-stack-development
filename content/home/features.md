Hello! I am Jiashuo Tong, an MSCS student at University of Southern California. Previously, I completed a B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Here is my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiashuotong/

I have done several exciting projects and two rewarding internships in software development. I have tremendous interest in frontend/full stack engineering. I also enjoy learning numerical analysis and computer graphics.

I created this website for two purposes:
1. Document my practical and theoretical knowledge in software development, data structures, algorithms, programming languages, etc. 
2. Let people know about my past experiences and connect myself with potential job opportunities.
