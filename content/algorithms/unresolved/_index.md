This is the place where I store all the problems to which I haven't found a reasonably fast solution.

1. Split a string into 3 non-empty parts such that `a+b != b+c != c+a`.
Here is a discussion I have found from StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65715189/spilt-string-in-3-non-empty-parts-such-that-a-b-b-c-and-c-a-are-all-diffent, but I feel there must be a much easier solution.
