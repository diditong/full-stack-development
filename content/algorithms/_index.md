Data structures and algorithms are highly related. An efficient algorithm usually comes with a nice choice of data structures. For example, when you need to record the items that are visited, hash set should be choice; when you want to from time to time retrieve the smallest or greatest from a list of values, you should find the min/max heaps pretty useful; when a one-to-one mapping is needed, an array is usually enough with hash map being another option. Besides these simple data structures, there are other more complicated data structures designed to solve specific types of problems, such as trie (a special tree-like data structure used to save words), monotonic stack (which is just stack that is monotonically increasing or decreasing), union find (or disjoint set used to maintain common ancestors). Therefore, I would find algorithms as steps that we have to take to solve any problem, and imagine data structures as the tools that facilitate one or more such steps.
