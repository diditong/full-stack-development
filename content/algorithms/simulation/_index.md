There are some problems in which you cannot formulate a faster solution other than the silly brute-force solution in 10 minutes. It is not always because you lack the training to detect a pattern. Quite often it is the brute force solution that is the anticipated answer. I call them simulation problems. Here are a list of such problems:

1. Almost Tetris: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/891654/postmates-oa-almost-tetris
2. Diagonal Traverse: https://leetcode.com/problems/diagonal-traverse/

One commonality of these problems is that a solution is already explicit in the problem statement. We don't need to waste the brain power trying to find another one. All we need to do is to directly code up that solution and debug it.
